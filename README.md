HelixIT: A comprehensive DNA analysis toolkit

Bioinformatics is the intersection of computational and biological sciences. A major subset of bioinformatics is genomics involving deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing and analysis. Parallel to the advancements in sequencing technology, analysis tools have also been created. DNA analysis is achieved through object-oriented programming (OOP), which imitates the complexity and adaptability of human cognitive processes. Here, we introduce an OOP based DNA analysis toolbox that will improve and streamline many elements of DNA sequence analysis, making it easier to analyze data comprehensively.
From simple sequence manipulation using kmers, complement and reverse complement, gc percentages and transcripts to complex functions like identifying primers, detecting hairpins, palindrome discovery, open reading frames, translation across all six frames, visualizations like open reading frame visualizer and kmer plots among others; our toolset has a vast range of capabilities. The program also has the added functionality of easing user input by a script that automates sequence accession from Entrez databases using just the accession id. Our Toolkit intends to enable scientists and medical professionals to investigate, decipher, and apply the enormous amount of genetic data for biological research and therapeutic uses by offering an extensive range of instruments for DNA analysis.
